This course provides guided learning in advanced statistical analysis, as applied to ecological research and other fields of marine science. Advanced concepts in probability, statistical model building, hypothesis testing, inference, estimation and prediction, including analyses of example data sets and problems. Students will be required to learn and present topics to the class that are relevant to their graduate research and complete a class project. Course materials will be presented using the statistical programming language R; a computer lab focused on introductory and intermediate R programming will be held for the first half of the semester.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nSelf-learning in advanced quantitative concepts and methods\nFamiliarity with advanced statistical methods\nExperience communicating advanced quantitative topics\nExperience in statistical programming\n\n\n\nCOVID-19\nWe are in the middle of a global pandemic and things are not normal. I want you to succeed in this course and will do what I can to help support your being able to meet our learning objectives. Please communicate with me if there are additional things I can do to help support you. I will not ask you to disclose information related to your reasons for such requests outside of what is needed to provide possible solutions.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nThis class follows the Fay Lab Code of Conduct, which applies to all class spaces, including classrooms, Zoom calls, class GoogleDocs or other materials, and student hours. You can also read my lab’s lab culture and philosophy, which underpins my approach to teaching and collaboration.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on this course website.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email. Make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nWe are here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend student hours (sometimes called ‘office hours’) to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so these times are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nIf you email me (Gavin), please include “MAR 536” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to MAR 536 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nStudents should have taken an introductory graduate statistics course (e.g. MAR 535 Biological Statistics I or equivalent), or seek permission from the instructor."

Attendance at all lectures and labs is the best way to understand topics and assignments, but is not required for evaluation.\nComputer lab exercises (20% of course grade). Completion of short laboratory exercises using R. Lab exercises are due before lab session the following week. Individual weekly exercises will not be assigned numeric grades, assessment of the R lab component will take the form of i) completion of the exercises and ii) two self-reflection statements in the middle and at the end of the course asking students to assess their learning in R and ability to use these tools to address data-related and scientific questions. Additionally, the instructor and teaching assistant will provide general and specific feedback on R lab components and coding.\nExtra credit: An additional 1% towards the total course grade can be obtained by students contributing to the #TidyTuesday, a public weekly data project in R from the R4DS online learning community (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). To obtain course credit, students should send Gavin Fay and Lucy McGinnis an email containing a visualization of analysis of one Tidy Tuesday data set, and a link to a repository containing code that reproduces the analysis and visualization (sharing of work with the #RStats community via Twitter or Mastodon is encouraged but not required for course credit)."

Requests for extended deadlines will be considered up to one day before the deadline. Unexcused assignments submitted later than three days after the deadline will not be graded.\nFailure to complete any of the requirements for evaluation will result in a score of zero for missing components. At the student’s request, and no more than 48 hours after the final exam or class, an incomplete grade may be given only in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. The student must be passing the course at the time of the request or be sufficiently close to passing that the instructor believes that upon completion of the work, the student will pass the course. If the work is not completed within one year of recording the I, the grade will become an F(I).\nThis 4-credit class involves four hours per week of in-class work and an average of eight hours per week of out-of-class work is expected.\nAssignment submissions should be made via a myCourses website. Students are responsible for all official correspondence sent to their umassd.edu e-mail address.\nThis course, including student participation, will be recorded on video by the instructor and will be available to students in the course for viewing remotely and after each session.

These disclosures include but are not limited to reports of sexual assault, relational abuse, relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While faculty are often able to help students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus, disclosure by the student to the faculty member requires that the faculty member inform the University’s Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at 508-999-8008 to help ensure that the student’s safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student requests that the disclosure not be shared.\nFor confidential counseling support and assistance, please go to http://www.umassd.edu/sexualviolence/"
