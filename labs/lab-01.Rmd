## Why R?

**Reproducible**\
- command line interface encourages organization\
- scripts allow others (and you!) to reproduce analyses from end-to-end\
- integration of analysis with document creation

**Extensible**\
- new methods delivered as developed\
- continual expansion through new packages

**Open-source**\
- all code can be examined by the user

**Free**\
- available to large set of users (and therefore developers)

R is not the only solution out there.\
The real goal is not to teach R, but concepts that all programming depends on.

Trevor Branch rule:

> "Every analysis you do on a dataset will have to be redone 10--15 times before publication. Plan accordingly."

## Recommended reading

R for Data Science, 2017 (Wickham and Grolemund)\
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>\
![](figs/r4ds.png)

## Recommended reading

An introduction to R (Venables et al.)\
-- <http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf>

R reference card 2.0 (Baggott)\
-- <http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf>\
-- Extremely useful handout: put on wall in view of your desk

Cheatsheets\
- <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/>

There are many (many) R books out there. Good for reference. e.g.\
- The R Book, 2007 (Crawley)\
- Modern Applied Statistics with S, 20002 (Venables and Ripley)\
- Introductory Statistics with R, 2002 (Dalgaard)

## Installing R and R Studio

**R** (<http://r-project.org>)\
- download appropriate version for your OS

**R Studio** (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>)\
- a very good Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R\
provides:\
- text editor\
- syntax highlighting\
- seamless code execution with R

You can use other text editors with R, but RStudio is well organized.\
(also looks the same regardless of Operating System)

## Using R today: RStudio Cloud

An alternative:

-   web browser interface\
    <https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/47288/project/856390>

## Getting started

Enter instructions at R console command line prompt (`>`):\
e.g. type

```{r,results='hide',prompt=TRUE,strip.white=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

R acts as a calculator and returns (prints) the result.

```{r,prompt=TRUE,strip.white=TRUE,collapse=TRUE,comment=''}
2 + 2
```

## Simple commands

```{r,prompt=TRUE,strip.white=TRUE,collapse=TRUE,comment=''}
3^2
2*(2+2)
2*2+2
log(10)
exp(1)
x <- 3
2*x
```

The `<-` means 'assign'. i.e. 'assign a value of 3 to the variable x'.\
`<-` is preferable to using `=`

## Scripts and RStudio

-   Typing commands into the console can get tedious.

-   Scripts are text files containing lines of code.

-   Scripts provide a complete record of analyses.

-   Code can be run (executed) from these files repeatedly.

-   Scripts can be created in a text editor and copied into the R console.

Or...

-   RStudio integrates scripts, R console, and output in a user-friendly development environment.

-   To run code in RStudio, select code and type\
    `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows)\
    `Command+Enter` (Mac)\
    The code will run in the R console.

## RStudio

![](figs/rstudiolayout2.png)

## Projects in RStudio

Good to keep all the files associated with a particular project organized together -- input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures.

RStudio has built-in support for this via its projects.

Projects provide an easy organization of your files and analyses.

R runs from a working directory, the location (folder) on your computer that R will use as a default when looking for data files, producing output, etc.

Project files (`.Rproj`)

When you open a project, RStudio sets the working directory to the folder in which the `.Rproj` file exists.

Using projects can be VERY helpful.

## Getting Help in R

R is a programming language, there is a learning curve.

Fortunately, there are lots of resources:

![](figs/notxkcd_priorities2.png)

**Don't** summon a wish-granting computer demon.

## Getting Help in R

R is a programming language, there is a learning curve.

Fortunately, there are lots of resources:\
- help files\
- online search results\
- books\
- colleagues\
- RStudio Community

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
```{r prompt=TRUE,results='hide',collapse=TRUE}
?(mean)
help("mean")
```

The above both get help for the function `mean`.\
Use `help.search("function.name")` to search across packages.

`str(object.name)` shows the structure of an object. \endgroup

## R Help files (`?mean`)

Common format:

-   Description (what the function does)\
-   Usage (how to use it)\
-   Arguments (what the function needs, options)\
-   Value (what does the function return)\
-   See Also (related functions)\
-   Examples (sample code showing how the function works)

Read function documentation and explore behavior by running examples!

## Lab exercise 1/4

(Instructions also in lab-exercise-01.pdf)

Start a new project. (call it biostats2 or something similar)\
Open a new R markdown file. Save it. (name it lastname_lab1.Rmd or something similar)\
At the top of the script, add comments with your name and lab 1.\
Work in pairs or individually.\
Submit your .Rmd file via myCourses before lab next week.

Write code that evaluates the following when run. $$7 + 5(4+3)$$ $$e^{-5(0.2+0.15)}$$ $$\frac{\sqrt{1+2(3+2)}}{\ln(3^2+2)}$$

## Objects

Common types of objects\
- Numbers\
- Characters (i.e. text or strings)\
- Tables\
- Vectors and matrices\
- Plots\
- Statistical output\
- Functions

Objects in R are global

Viewing objects: In RStudio see top-right Workspace tab\
More generally:\
\begingroup \fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',results='hide',eval=FALSE}
  print(myobject)
  myobject
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
`ls()` lists all objects in the workspace.\
Use `rm()` to remove an object.

## Data types (modes)

Describe how objects are stored in computer memory.

In R you do ***not*** need to specify the data type.

Common data types:

-   Numeric (integer, floating point numbers or doubles)

-   Logical (Boolean, true or false)

-   Characters (text or string data)

Types are not always obvious in R, but can be important to know.

## Data types II

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',strip.white=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
myobject <- log(10)
mode(myobject)
is.numeric(myobject)
typeof(myobject)
newobject <- as.integer(myobject)
typeof(newobject)
is.character(myobject)
typeof("hello world")
```

## Vectors

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
weights <- c(2.3,5.4,7.5,9)
print(weights)
years <- 2007:2016
print(years)
years <- seq(from=2000,to=2016,by=2)
print(years)
x <- rep(3,times=10)
print(x)
rep(1:3,times=3)
rep(1:3,length=10)
```

## More on Vectors

Vectors are ordered and can be referred to by element(s) using \[ \]

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE}
(years <- 2007:2016)
years[3]
years[5:6]
which(years==2010)
years[-c(2,4)] # A negative index excludes elements
```

Vector operations are element-wise

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE}
(x <- 1:5)
2*x
```

## Lab exercise 2/4

(Instructions also in lab-exercise-01.pdf)

Create vectors using `seq()`, `rep()`, and mathematical operators. Only use `c()` when absolutely necessary.\
*hint* Remember you can get help on a function by typing `?functionname`

-   Positive integers from 1 to 99\
-   Odd integers between 1 and 99\
-   The numbers 1,1,1, 2,2,2, 3,3,3\
-   The numbers -5,-4,-3,-5,-4,-3,-5,-4,-3\
-   The fractions 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ..., 1/10\
-   The cubes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216

## Useful functions

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE}
x <- c(5,3,2,6,3,9,1,18)
length(x)  # length of vector x
sort(unique(x))  # sorted vector of unique values in x
min(x)     # minimum value in x
max(x)     # maximum value in x
mean(x)    # mean of x
median(x)  # median of x
sd(x)      # standard deviation of x
range(x)   # range of values in x
range(x)[2]  # 2nd element of values returned by range()
quantile(x) # optional argument 'probs' can be handy
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Boolean logic operators

| Operator              | R Code    |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| AND                   | & (&&)    |
| OR                    | \| (\|\|) |
| NOT                   | !         |
| less than             | \<        |
| greater than          | \>        |
| less than or equal    | \<=       |
| greater than or equal | \>=       |
| equals                | ==        |
| NOT equal             | !=        |

&& and \|\| are used when asking IF statements.\
These only use a single value, not a vector.

## Boolean examples

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont
```
```{r comment='',prompt=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
x <- 7 
x == 7 
x < 10 
x < -3 
x > 0 & x <= 12
x >= 10 | x < 0 
```

```{r comment='',prompt=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
y <- c(4,8)
y > 5   #returns a logical vector
y[y>5]  #returns elements of y that meet condition
which(y>5) #index of y that meets condition
any(y>5)
all(y>5)
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Lab exercise 3/4

Complete the following using the vector `y`:

`y <- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5)`

-   Display the first and last values.\
-   Find the last value for a vector of any length.\
-   Display the values that are greater than the mean of `y`.\
-   Display the positions (indices) of the values greater than the mean.\
-   Are all the values positive?\
-   Are any of the values equal to the mean?\
-   Are any of the values equal to the median?

## Other types of objects

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
***matrices*** (more generally, arrays)\
- multi-dimensional generalizations of vectors.\
- are vectors that can be indexed by two or more indices.

***factors***\
- compact ways to handle categorical data.

***lists***\
- general form of vector, elements need not be the same type.\
- elements often themselves vectors or lists.\
- convenient way to return results of statistical computations.

***dataframes***\
- matrix-like structures, columns can be of different types.\
- often 'data matrices' with one row per observational unit but with (possibly) both numerical and categorical variables.\
- experiments are often best described by data frames: treatments are categorical but the response is numeric.

***functions***\
- are themselves objects in R which can be stored in the project's workspace.\
- provide a simple and convenient way to extend R.

```{=tex}

```
## Dataframes

There are lots of data set examples in R.\
e.g. record times for 35 Scottish hill races\
\begingroup \fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,R.options=library(MASS)}
library(MASS)
head(hills,n=3) # shows first few lines. Also tail()
names(hills)  # get the names of the data frame
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
Creating dataframes \begingroup \fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE}
fish <- c("cod","haddock","dogfish","pollock")
length <- c(34,23,75,18)
age <- c(6,3,17,2)
fish.data <- data.frame(fish=fish,length=length,age=age)
head(fish.data)
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Extracting information from data frames

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
Use the \$ to extract vectors from a data frame

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,R.options=library(MASS)}
hills$dist
```

You can also specify the row index, column index, or both `object[row,column]`

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,R.options=library(MASS)}
# extract the element in row 1, column 2
hills[1,2]
hills$climb[1]
# extract the first row
hills[1,]
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,R.options=library(MASS)}
# extract all of column 2
hills[,2]   # also hills[,"climb"]
# exclude column 1, but retain the other columns (1st 3 rows)
hills[1:3,-1]  
# extract rows 4 and 7
hills[c(4,7),]
# extract the rows that are specified by the object x
x <- c(4,7,nrow(hills))
hills[x,]
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Extracting information from data frames (2)

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
The 'tidyverse' is a popular set of R packages for interacting with data and performing statistical analyses.\
Data frames are commonly used in a structure called a 'tibble'

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE}
hills_tbl <- as_tibble(hills)
hills_tbl
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
Extract variables using the `select` verb function in the `dplyr` package

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,R.options=library(MASS)}
dplyr::select(hills,dist)
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a new variable of the race names

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE}
  hills_tbl <- mutate(hills_tbl,race=rownames(hills))
  hills_tbl <- dplyr::select(hills_tbl,race,everything())
  hills_tbl
```

## Quickly visualize the dataset

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont
```
```{r, out.width='70%'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = hills_tbl, mapping = aes(x=dist,y=time)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = climb), alpha = 1/3) +
  xlab("Distance (miles)") +
  ylab("Record Time (mins)") +
  xlim(0,30) + ylim(0,225)
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Extracting elements logically

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont
```
```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
fish <- c("cod","haddock","dogfish","pollock")
length <- c(34,23,75,18)
age <- c(6,3,17,2)
fish_data <- tibble(fish=fish,length=length,age=age)
fish_data$age   # a vector
fish_data$age > 5  # a logical vector
filter(fish_data, age>5) #avoids having to create a logical vector
# combining conditions
filter(fish_data, age > 5, fish == "dogfish")
filter(fish_data, length < 25 | length >= 50)
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Using the Pipe

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont
```
Combine verb operations with the pipe operator (`|>`) e.g.

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
fish_data |>
  mutate(weight = (length/100)^3) |>
  filter(age > 5)
```

The pipe passes the result from one function call to the next.\
Can be read as "and then".\
(also the older tidyverse pipe: %\>% )\
\endgroup

## Summarizing Data

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont
```
After selecting data we might like to perform analyses on it.\
We can use `group_by()` to recognize structure in the data.\
Then apply functions to variables using `summarize()`\
Recall gapminder data, find the average life expectancy in 2007 for each continent

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
#install.packages('gapminder')
library(gapminder)
gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007) |> 
  group_by(continent) |>
  summarize(avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

```{=tex}
\endgroup
```
## Tips and Tricks

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
**Comments**\
Use comments within R code to document the purpose of your code. Anything on a line after a `#` is ignored by R. RStudio uses a different color to help readability.

**SAVE** your scripts(!), not workspaces. Use meaningful variable names. Adopt a coding style and use consistently.\
(e.g. <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml>)

The `str()` function can be incredibly helpful when querying objects.

```{r prompt=TRUE,comment='',collapse=TRUE,R.options=library(MASS)}
str(hills)
```

Make use of `help()` documentation.

There are almost always multiple ways of getting the same result.\
We'll mostly use low level functions to help you understand how R works.\
Some advanced functions are cleaner and do things more quickly.\
\endgroup

## Lab exercise 4/4 (data frames using `hills`)

```{=tex}
\begingroup
\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
```
1.  Display the first 5 rows of the `hills` dataframe.\
2.  Find the fastest time.\
3.  Display the hill races (and distance, climbs, and times) with the 3 fastest times.\
4.  Extract and display the record time for Cairngorm.\
5.  Find how many hill races have a climb greater than the mean.\
6.  Display the names of the hill races that have a climb greater than the mean.\
7.  Display the names and times of the races that are at least 10 miles long and have a climb greater than 4000 feet.\
8.  Find the positions (indices) of hills that either have a climb greater than 5000 feet or have a record time less than 20 minutes.\
9.  Find the standard deviation of the record times for all races except for the highest climb, the Bens of Jura.\
10. Display the range (minimum and maximum) of the average speed for the races.\
11. Find the race that had the fastest average speed.\
12. **BONUS** Find the mean of the record times for races whose names start with letters A through K.
